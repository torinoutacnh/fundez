                            FundEZ Account (a “FundEZ Account”). During the registration process, we will

                            ask you for information to verify your identity. We may, in our sole discretion,
                            refuse to open an account for you, or limit the number of FundEZ Accounts that you may hold. Note that depending on your jurisdiction, you may be required to meet additional qualifications.

                            5.   Identity Verification. During registration of your FundEZ Account, you agree to provide us with the information we request for the purposes of identity verification and so that we can fulfill our obligations to detect illegal activity such as money laundering, terrorist financing, and fraud. You also agree to permit us to keep a record of such information. You will need to complete certain verification procedures before you are permitted to use the Services. Your access to our Services may be limited, altered, or refused as a result of information
                            collected about you during the initial onboarding procedures and on an ongoing basis. The information we request may include certain personal information,
                            including, but not limited to, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, date of birth, taxpayer identification number, social security number, a government issued identification, and information regarding your bank account (such as the name of the bank, the account type, routing number, and account number). In providing us with this or any other required information, you
                            confirm that the information is true and accurate and complete. You agree to promptly update your identity information upon any changes. You authorize us and our third-party service providers to make inquiries that we consider necessary to verify your identity or to protect you and/or us against fraud or other financial crime, and to take all action we deem necessary as a result of such inquiries. You acknowledge and agree that your personal information may be
                            disclosed to check credit references and fraud prevention or financial crime agencies and that these agencies may respond to our inquiries in full. Please note this is an identity check only and should have no adverse effect on your credit
                            rating. These inquiries may include, but are not limited to, authorizing your wireless operator to use your mobile number, name, address, email, network
                            status, customer type, customer role, billing type, mobile device identifiers and other subscriber status details, if available, solely to allow verification of your
                            identity and to compare information you have provided with your wireless operator account profile information for the duration of the business
                            relationship. FundEZ shall not be liable for any loss suffered as a result of such inquiries. Additionally, we may require you to wait some amount of time before permitting you to use certain Services.

                            regulatory changes or actions that may adversely affect the use, transfer, exchange and value of Digital Assets; Digital Assets are not insured by the FDIC

                            or SIPC and do not receive any other similar protections; and Digital Assets may have an increased risk of fraud or cyber attack. For additional information, see our FAQs.

                            PART 3: DIGITAL ASSET WALLETS
                        </h5>
                        <p>
                            1.   General. Digital asset wallets are provided by third party custodians which are not owned or controlled by FundEZ. Through these third party custodian wallets, we enable you to monitor the storage, tracking and management of Digital Assets contained in a hosted digital currency wallet. You will have the ability to request, send and receive (by placing orders), and store Digital Assets from third parties
                            by giving instructions through the Site. We may limit this functionality, and we may require you to verify your identity prior to engaging in certain transactions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            2.   Supported Digital Assets. The wallet services are available only in connection with those Digital Assets and protocols that FundEZ, in its sole discretion,
                            supports. Under no circumstances should you attempt to use your Wallet to store, send, request, or receive Digital Assets and protocols that we do not support. We assume no responsibility in connection with any attempt to use your wallet with Digital Assets that we do not support.  The Digital Assets we
                            support may change from time to time, based on our sole and absolute discretion. We will notify you in advance if we cease to support a particular Digital Asset.
                            FundEZ reserves the right to refuse to process, or to cancel or reverse, any
                            instructions for the purchase or sale of a Digital Asset in its sole discretion, even after funds have been debited from your account(s), if we suspect the transaction involves (or has a high risk of involvement in) money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, or any other type of financial crime as required by law or in
                            response to a subpoena, court order, or other binding government order or to enforce limits we have placed on your account or for other compliance reasons.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            3.   Commingled Digital Assets. FundEZ may use shared blockchain addresses,
                            controlled by FundEZ or its custodian partners, to hold Digital Assets at third party custodians on behalf of users and/or on behalf of FundEZ. Although we maintain separate ledgers for users and proprietary accounts, FundEZ shall have no obligation to segregate by blockchain address Digital Assets owned by you from Digital Assets owned by others.

                            PART 4: USD WALLETS
                        </h5>

                        <p>
                            1.   USD Wallets. Certain approved Users may establish and fund a U.S. Dollar balance ("USD Wallet") with our custodian banking partner to facilitate
                            transactions. You are the owner of the balance of your USD Wallet. FundEZ holds your USD balance in a dedicated custodial account with Silvergate Bank (“USD Custodian”).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            2.   Deposits and Withdrawals. You may fund your USD Wallet via wire transfer or Automated Clearing House (“ACH”) transfer from your linked bank account.
                            FundEZ will not charge a fee for you to transfer funds to or from your USD
                            Wallet, but bank transfer fees may apply, and fees from our USD Custodian may apply. Your initiation of a fiat currency withdrawal using your User Account
                            login credentials will be deemed to be your authorization for us to execute the
                            withdrawal. You may not deposit USD from, or withdraw USD to, bank accounts held by third parties.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            ACH Transfers. For users who deposit USD via ACH transfer, limitations,
                            conditions, and restrictions may be placed on funds available for immediate use. Such funds, and any Digital Assets purchased with such funds, will be withheld from withdrawal until they are considered settled (typically within five to seven business days). Once your ACH deposit is considered settled, you will be able to withdraw these funds and any Digital Assets you bought with them. You agree
                            that ACH deposit settlement times are subject to bank holidays, the internal processes and jurisdictions of your bank, and the internal processes of our banking partners. You further agree that, in certain situations, ACH deposit
                            settlement times may be delayed in connection with scheduled downtime or other disruptions to our service providers. To the extent your ACH deposit does not
                            settle, you will not be able to withdraw any assets from your Wallets until you have made sufficiently settled deposits to your USD Wallet to satisfy the initial ACH deposit, and FundEZ reserves all rights of legal recourse against you.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            All Other Transfers. For other deposit types, FundEZ will credit your USD Wallet with a corresponding amount of dollars after funds are delivered to our USD
                            Custodian. For wire transfers, funds will typically be available within one to three business days. For withdrawals, FundEZ will immediately instruct our USD
                            Custodian to debit your USD Wallet when you authorize a withdrawal (subject to the ACH-related limitations described above) and funds will typically settle to you within two to three business days. We may not process a transfer instruction if associated bank fees exceed the value of the transfer.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            3.   Commingled USD Account. We may use an omnibus account, controlled by us or our USD Custodian, to hold USD on behalf of our users. We may invest these funds in liquid investments, such as U.S. treasuries, in accordance with state money transmitter laws. FundEZ owns the interest or other earnings on such
                            investments. FundEZ shall have no obligation to segregate any user's USD from

                            any other user's USD, and we may rely upon an internal ledger to indicate the amount of USD that is owned by each client.

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            1.   Digital Asset Transactions. We process transactions according to the instructions you submit to us. We do not guarantee the identity of any user, receiver, or another party; therefore, you should verify that all information is correct prior to sending instructions to us. If you submit an order, that order will be irrevocable and final unless that order is cancelled prior to execution. Any pending
                            withdrawals from your FundEZ Account that have been submitted to a Digital Asset network will be unconfirmed for a period of time pending sufficient
                            confirmation of the transaction by the Digital Asset network. Transactions in a pending state may not be available for FundEZ to reverse or otherwise alter the
                            transaction. The funds used for your pending transactions will not be displayed in your account balance or be available to conduct other transactions.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            2.  Operation of Digital Asset Protocols. FundEZ does not own or control the underlying software protocols that govern the operation of Digital Assets
                            supported on our platform. In general, the underlying protocols are open source and anyone can use, copy, modify, and distribute them. By using our Services, you acknowledge and agree (i) that we are not responsible for operation of the underlying protocols and that we make no guarantee of their functionality,
                            security, or availability; and (ii) that the underlying protocols are subject to
                            sudden changes in operating rules (a/k/a “forks”) that could materially affect the value, function, name, and other attributes of the Digital Asset. In the event of a fork, you agree that we may temporarily suspend operations (with or without advance notice to you) and that we may, in our sole discretion, decide whether or not to support either branch of the forked protocol entirely. You acknowledge and agree that FundEZ has no responsibility whatsoever for a branch of a forked protocol that is unsupported.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            3.  FundEZ Processes. FundEZ may act as agent or principal in facilitating your purchases and sales of Digital Assets on the FundEZ platforms or across the platforms and may receive remuneration for doing so. FundEZ may also
                            incentivize third parties to use our platforms. You and all users, including FundEZ and its associated persons, are strictly prohibited from engaging in
                            fraudulent or manipulative activity including, but not limited to, insider trading and front-running.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            4.   Purchases and Sales. After successfully completing the verification procedures, you may purchase supported Digital Assets by funding your FundEZ Account and may sell supported Digital Assets by transferring the applicable Digital Asset to your FundEZ Account. You authorize FundEZ and our custodian partners, as applicable, to initiate credits and debits in your FundEZ Account in settlement of transactions. A Transaction Fee applies to all transactions. Although FundEZ and

                            our partner custodians will attempt to deliver supported Digital Assets to your account as promptly as possible, funds may be debited from your selected payment method before the Digital Asset is delivered and viewable in your
                            FundEZ Account. Your receipt of funds upon withdrawal from your FundEZ Account will depend on the payment type, and may take up to six or more
                            business days.

                            We and our custodian partners will use best efforts to fulfill all orders, but are under no obligation to do so. To secure the performance of your obligations under this Agreement, you may be required to grant to FundEZ or its custodian partner a lien on and security interest in and to the balances in your FundEZ Account.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            5.   Reversals Cancellations. You cannot cancel, reverse, or change any transaction marked as “Complete,” and you may not be able to cancel, reverse, or change any transaction marked as “Pending.”
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            6.  Digital Asset Storage Transmission Delays. Digital assets are securely held in either online or offline storage or a combination of both. As a result, it may be necessary for FundEZ to communicate with our custodian partners to retrieve certain information from offline storage in order to facilitate a Digital Asset
                            transaction in accordance with your instructions, which, in turn, may delay the initiation or crediting of your transaction for 48 hours or longer. You acknowledge and agree that a Digital Asset transaction facilitated by FundEZ may be delayed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            7.   Debts. If your payment is not successful or if your payment method has
                            insufficient funds, you authorize FundEZ, in its sole discretion, to cancel the
                            transaction or to debit your other payment methods in any amount necessary to complete the transaction. You are responsible for maintaining an adequate
                            balance in order to avoid overdraft.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            8.   Third Parties. FundEZ has no control over, or liability for, the delivery, quality,
                            safety, legality or any other aspect of any goods or services that you may purchase or sell to or from a third party (including other users). FundEZ is not responsible for ensuring that a buyer or a seller you may transact with will actually complete the transaction or is authorized to do so. If you experience a problem with any goods or services purchased from, or sold to, a third party in connection with a Digital Asset transferred using our Site or Services, or if you have a dispute with
                            such third party, you must resolve the dispute directly with that third party. If you believe a third party has behaved in a fraudulent, misleading, or
                            inappropriate manner, or if you cannot adequately resolve a dispute with a third party, you may notify @SystemHelper.Setting.ApplicationName Support at @config.SupportEmail  so that we may
                            consider what action to take, if any.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            9.   Promotions. We may conduct promotions and special offers and reserve the right to establish qualifying user criteria to participate in these promotions and offers.

                            FundEZ shall have no obligation to make promotions and special offers available to all users and may revoke these events at any time without notice.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            10.  Fees and Other Remuneration. Generally, we receive compensation for our Services by charging fees based on a percentage of the transaction or by taking a
                            spread. Our custodian partners may also charge fees for their services. Fees such as withdrawal fees and network fees (miner fees) to process a Digital Asset
                            transaction on your behalf may be charged. Network fees will vary between Digital Assets and during periods of high network traffic. Certain minimums apply to the fees we charge. You can view the schedule of currently applicable fees per pairing and payment method at our Fees page here. We will notify you of any fees prior to your confirmation of your order. We do not refund our fees for
                            completed transactions unless we have agreed to do so in writing or otherwise
                            required by law. You hereby agree to pay all applicable fees and to be responsible for paying fees charged by your financial service provider.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            11.   Records. Prior to executing any transaction on our platform, we will provide you with notice of the terms and conditions of the transactions, including the amount of the transaction, the costs associated with the transaction, the type and nature of the transaction, and a warning that, once executed, the transaction may not be undone. After you execute a transaction on our platform, as well as successful withdrawals and deposits, we will send you an email receipt as evidence of the transaction. In addition, a statement of account is available to users through our Platform.
                        </p>

                            PART 6: STAKING
                        </h5>

                        <p>
                            1.   Staking Services. When you hold Digital Assets in your FundEZ Account, you may be able to “stake” these assets in a third-party proof-of-stake network via
                            staking services facilitated by FundEZ. In a proof-of-stake network, transaction validators are chosen using a formula based on ownership of the underlying Digital Asset as opposed to computing power (i.e., proof of work). Our custodian partners will stake these assets on your behalf. In addition, FundEZ entities or its service providers may serve as transaction validators or similar nodes on their own behalf on the networks where these assets are staked. In this capacity, neither FundEZ nor its affiliated entities uses your Digital Assets.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            2.   Optional Staking. Unless otherwise provided, staking services will be made by default for Digital Assets where staking functionality is available through your FundEZ Account . You hereby explicitly agree to the default staking of your Digital Assets. YOU ARE NOT REQUIRED TO STAKE WITH FUNDEZ AND YOU CAN OPT-OUT OF FUNDEZ’S STAKING SERVICES AT ANY TIME BY EMAILING @config.SupportEmail. @SystemHelper.Setting.ApplicationName may take three (3) business days or
                            longer to reflect your choice not to stake your Digital Assets. If you opt-out of staking services, you can opt back in at any time.

                            Should you choose to stake any Digital Assets held in your FundEZ Account,
                            these Digital Assets may be locked (unavailable for withdrawal or trading) for up

                            to three business days (or as otherwise applicable pursuant to the underlying protocol) from any withdrawal or trading request.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            3.   Staking Service; Rewards; Commission. If you stake your assets with our service, the protocol or our custodian partners will stake these on your behalf, acting as a transaction validator on the applicable network for the Digital Asset you stake. If the protocol or our custodian partner successfully validates a block of
                            transactions in the applicable Digital Asset, you may earn a reward granted by
                            that Digital Asset’s network. Your reward will be determined by the protocols of
                            the applicable network. FundEZ will distribute this reward to you pro rata, minus a commission set forth on https://@SystemHelper.Setting.ApplicationName paid to FundEZ. Staking
                            rewards are not provided by us, are not guaranteed and are subject to the
                            individual protocol of the applicable Digital Asset, and may change at any time without notice. FundEZ does not distribute any rewards earned when serving as a transaction validator or similar network node on its own behalf.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            4.   Automatic Voting Proxy. If you stake your assets with us, you agree to give us, the protocol, our custodian or node operation partners your proxy to vote on any governance issues relating to the staked Digital Asset, and you waive any right to any claim related to any such voting right. Further, unless we or our custodian partner determines that it is in the best interests of such custodian partner,
                            FundEZ, or you to vote on such governance matters, the custodian or node operation partner shall abstain from participating in any such vote.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            5.  No Guarantee. You have no right to a reward until it is received by the designated protocol or our custodian partner and processed by FundEZ and until you have maintained a positive balance for at least three (3) consecutive days during the applicable period. Your reward will be distributed on a pro-rata basis based on your average balance of the particular Digital Asset to the total of all rewards
                            received by our custodian partner and processed by FundEZ during the applicable period. Rewards will be distributed to your FundEZ Account once per month unless otherwise provided. FundEZ will use reasonable efforts to facilitate the staking of any Digital Assets for which you are using FundEZ’s staking
                            services. The “staking rewards rate” is disclosed by FundEZ for each particular Digital Asset. For any Digital Asset listed for less than 90 days, FundEZ shall use commercially reasonable efforts to determine a reward rate that it determines is reasonably likely to be achieved for the following month. This rate is an estimate and changes over time.
                            <strong>
                                FUNDEZ DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT YOU WILL RECEIVE ANY STAKING REWARDS, ANY SPECIFIC STAKING REWARD, OR ANY STAKING RETURN OVER TIME, INCLUDING THE STAKING REWARDS RATE. ALL SUCH REWARDS ARE BASED ENTIRELY ON THE UNDERLYING PROTOCOL OF THE APPLICABLE DIGITAL ASSET.
                            </strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            FundEZ reserves the right in its sole and absolute discretion to cease providing staking services, including discontinuing the accrual of any rewards, in the
                            event that FundEZ suspects any fraud, misconduct, potential compromise of the underlying protocol or any other Prohibited Use or Prohibited Business.
                        </p>

                            3.   Third-Party Applications. If you grant express permission to a third party to access or connect to your FundEZ Account or otherwise use our Site or Services on your behalf, you acknowledge that granting permission does not relieve you of any of your responsibilities under this Agreement.

                            4.  Prohibited Use. In connection with your use of the Services, and your interactions with other users and third parties, you agree and represent you will not engage in any Prohibited Business or Prohibited Use, as defined herein. We reserve the
                            right at all times to monitor, review, retain and/or disclose any information as

                            necessary to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, sanctions programs, legal process or governmental request. If we determine, in our sole discretion, that your account or use of our Services is associated with a Prohibited Use or a Prohibited Business, we reserve the right to cancel or suspend your account, block your transactions, freeze your funds, or take any other action we deem necessary or appropriate. We reserve the right to take any of these actions
                            immediately, indefinitely, and without notice to you.

                            5.  Transaction Limits. The use of all Services may be subject to a limit on the amount of volume, you may transact or transfer in a given period (e.g., daily). To view your limits, login to your FundEZ Account. Your transaction limits may vary depending on your payment method, verification steps you have completed, and other factors. FundEZ reserves the right to change applicable limits as we deem necessary in our sole discretion. If you wish to raise your limits beyond the posted amounts, you may submit a request at @config.SupportEmail. We may require you to submit additional information about yourself or your business, provide records, and arrange for meetings with FundEZ staff (such process, “Enhanced Due Diligence”). FundEZ reserves the right to charge you costs and fees associated with Enhanced Due Diligence, provided that we notify you in advance of any such charges accruing. In our sole discretion, we may refuse to raise your limits or we may lower your limits at a
                            subsequent time even if you have completed Enhanced Due Diligence.

                            cancel your account if: we are so required by a facially valid subpoena, court order, or binding order of a government authority; we reasonably suspect you of using your FundEZ Account in connection with a Prohibited Use or Business; your use of your FundEZ Account or our Services is subject to any pending
                            litigation, investigation, or government proceeding and/or we perceive a heightened risk of legal or regulatory non-compliance associated with your activity; our service partners are unable to support your use; or you take any action that FundEZ deems as circumventing our controls, including, but not limited to, opening multiple FundEZ Accounts or abusing promotions which FundEZ may offer from time to time. We are not responsible for any losses,
                            whether direct or indirect, that you may incur as a result of our compliance with applicable law and regulations, the guidance or direction of any regulatory authority or government agency, or any writ of attachment, lien, levy, subpoena, warrant, or other legal order.

                            If FundEZ suspends or closes your account, or terminates your use of the Services for any reason, we will provide you with notice of our actions unless a
                            court order or other legal or regulatory process prohibits FundEZ from providing you with such notice. You acknowledge that FundEZ’s decision to take certain actions, including limiting access to, suspending, or closing your Account, may be based on confidential criteria that are essential to FundEZ’s risk management

                            and security protocols. You agree that FundEZ is under no obligation to disclose the details of its risk management and security procedures to you.

                            by a facially valid subpoena or court order or (iii) due to a violation of the
                            terms of this agreement including but not limited to a Prohibited Use violation, unless by operation of law or with the express permission of FundEZ Markets. You may cancel your FundEZ Account at any time by withdrawing all balances from your account and contacting us. You will not be charged for canceling your account, but you may be required to pay withdrawal fees and any outstanding amounts owed to us or our custodian partners. You authorize us to cancel or
                            suspend any pending transactions at the time of cancellation.

If we have reason to suspect your death, we will freeze your account, and no transactions may be completed until we ascertain the fact of your death. You authorize us to make inquiries, whether directly or through third parties, that we consider necessary to ascertain this information and if applicable, your designated beneficiary. If we receive confirmation of your death and
                            information on your designated beneficiary in a form satisfactory to us, we will
                            work with your designated beneficiary in taking appropriate action to transfer the account.
                        </p>

                            8.   Relationship of the Parties. FundEZ is an independent contractor for all purposes. Nothing in this Agreement shall deem or cause you and FundEZ to be treated as partners, joint ventures, or otherwise as joint associates for profit.

                            11.   Unclaimed Property. If you have assets or funds in your account, and FundEZ is unable to contact you and has no record of your use of our Services for a year or more, applicable law may require us to report and/or deliver these assets or funds as unclaimed property to the applicable jurisdiction. Prior to doing so,
                            FundEZ will try to locate you with the information shown in our records.
                            FundEZ reserves the right to deduct a dormancy fee or other administrative charges from such unclaimed funds, as permitted by applicable law.

                            1.   Contact FundEZ. If you have any feedback, questions, or complaints, email us at @config.SupportEmail. When you contact us please provide us with your name, address, and any other information that we may need to identify you, your

                            2.   Arbitration. We will attempt to resolve any disputes through our support team. If we cannot find a mutually agreeable resolution, you and we agree that any
                            dispute arising under this Agreement shall be finally settled in binding arbitration, on an individual basis, conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator in the Southern District of New York in accordance with the JAMS rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The arbitrator may award any relief that a court of competent jurisdiction could award, including attorneys' fees when authorized by law, and the arbitral decision may be enforced in any court. At your request, hearings may be conducted in person or by telephone and the arbitrator may provide for submitting and
                            determining motions on briefs, without oral hearings. If the arbitrator(s) or arbitration administrator would impose filing fees or other administrative costs on you, we will reimburse you, upon request, to the extent such fees or costs
                            would exceed those that you would otherwise have to pay if you were proceeding in a court. We will pay additional fees or costs if required to do so by the JAMS

                            rules or applicable law. The prevailing party in any action or proceeding to enforce this agreement shall be entitled to costs and attorneys' fees.

                            deemed to waive, preclude or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (i) bring an individual action in small claims court; (ii) pursue an enforcement action
                            through the applicable federal, state or local agency if that action is available; (iii) seek injunctive relief in aid of arbitration from a court of competent jurisdiction; or (iv) file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement

                            1. All trades are final.

                        <p>
                            2.  All Fills are final and will not be reversed unless:<br />
                            - FundEZ is compelled to do so by any applicable law or regulation; or<br />
                            - Due to a serious technical error, Orders or Fills do not occur as specified in these Rules - in which case FundEZ will make all reasonable efforts to
                            restore all Users to the position they would have been in had the error not occurred.<br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            3.  FundEZ may cancel Open Orders in the following circumstances:
                            <ul>
                                <li>a.  Orders placed by Users who, in our sole discretion, have engaged in Prohibited Use or abusive use of the platform, for example, Market Manipulation.</li>
                                <li>
                                    b.  Orders which under the circumstances involve an obvious error with respect to price, quantity, or other parameters - a “clearly erroneous transaction.”
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    c.  If required by any applicable law or regulation, including specifically where FundEZ is required to suspend or terminate a User's FundEZ Account.

                                <li>

                            4.  Interruptions
                            a. If technical reasons prevent or degrade a Users' ability to place or cancel Orders, or prevent or degrade access to FundEZ Sites or affect the operation of FundEZ Order Books or matching engines, then FundEZ may, in its discretion, take one or more of the following actions in respect of one or more Order Books:<br />
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i. Cancel Open Orders.<br />
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ii. Disable the ability to place new Orders (Cancel-Only Mode).<br />
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iii. Disable sign-in.<br />
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iv. Disable access to the FundEZ Site.<br />
                            b. If access to FundEZ through the FundEZ Site is unavailable for a prolonged period of time but the RFQ or matching engine is still operational, FundEZ will move to Cancel-Only Mode as soon as reasonably possible.<br />
                            c. If FundEZ is in Cancel-only Mode, it will be restored to fully operational only after access through the FundEZ Site becomes available for a
                            reasonable amount of time and FundEZ deems it is safe to restore full operations.<br />
                            d. FundEZ will notify Users of the move to or from Cancel-Only Mode via email, Twitter and/or through posting on the https://@SystemHelper.Setting.ApplicationName/ website.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            5.  Self-Trade Prevention<br />
                            a. Users are not able to place an Order which would result in
                            self-execution—i.e., where the same User would act as both the maker and taker for the trade.<br />
                            b. If two Orders of the same quantity would result in self-execution, both Orders are canceled.<br />
                            c. According to self-trade prevention rules, if two Orders of different quantities would result in self-execution you may specify the follow actions:<br />
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i.  Keep Newest (default) When self-crossing orders are detected, the newest orders of the crossing set are kept and any orders that cross with them are excluded from participating in the auction. See below for what happens to the excluded orders.<br />
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ii. Keep Oldest (keep-oldest) When self-crossing orders are detected, the oldest orders of the crossing set are kept and any orders that
                            cross with them are excluded from participating in the auction. See below for what happens to the excluded orders.<br />

                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iii. Cancel All (cancel-all) When self-crossing orders are detected, the entire set of crossing orders are rejected and do not participate in the auction. The rest of the user's (non-crossing) orders are not affected.<br />
                            d. When orders are excluded from an auction they will be rejected and not eligible to participate in future auctions unless all three of the following
                            conditions are met: 1) the excluded order was a limit order, 2) the order it was across from was a market order, and 3) the auction crosses at a price that would not have filled the limit order. In that case, the limit order is
                            retained in the order book and is eligible to participate in future auctions.<br />
                            e. Flash Crashes and Circuit Breakers. FundEZ does not use circuit breakers or automated trading halts based on predetermined price bands. As provided herein, FundEZ may, in its discretion, halt trading.

                            a. All Users are prohibited from engaging in Market Manipulation.<br />
                            b. Market Manipulation of any kind is strictly prohibited. Market Manipulation is defined as actions taken by any market participant or a person acting in concert with a participant which are intended to:<br />

                        <p>
                            9.  Order Minimums and Maximums<br />
                            a. Order Minimums. Orders placed on FundEZ may be subject to the minimum order sizes.<br />
                            - Purchase Orders - order minimums are enforced on the quote asset. For example, the ETH-USD book may have a minimum size of 510 USD.<br />
                            - Sale Orders - order minimums are enforced in the base asset. For example, the BTC-USD book may have a minimum size of 0.001 BTC.<br />
                            b. Order Maximums. Orders placed on FundEZ may be subject to maximum order sizes. For example: on the ETH-BTC Order Book, orders
                            denominated in ETH may be subject to a 600 ETH maximum, orders denominated in BTC may be subject to a 50 BTC maximum.<br />
                            c. Updating Order Minimums and Maximums. FundEZ will periodically update these Order Minimums and Order Maximums to reflect the current state of our marketplace and the notional value of the assets.<br />
                            d. User Specific Order Minimums and Maximums. FundEZ may restrict an
                            individual user’s minimum and maximum order sizes at its sole discretion.

                        <p>
                            Open Order Book Trading. FundEZ operates a periodic auction trading platform, and
                            settles trades in a number of Digital Assets and Fiat Currency Trading Pairs. Each User's Account will list which Order Books are available to the User. The following set of Rules governs Orders placed via the open Order Books.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Orders Generally
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            1.  To place an Order on an Order Book, a User must have an available balance of the relevant quote asset (for a buy order) or base asset (for a sell order) in their Account which is sufficient to cover the total value of the Order plus any applicable fees.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            2.  When a User places an Order, that quantity of the relevant base or quote asset becomes subject to a Hold.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            3.  A User can place the following types of Order:<br />
                            - Limit Order<br />
                            - Market Order (Buy or Sell)<br />
                            - Stop Order<br />
                            - Take Profit Order
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            4.  A User may request to cancel any open non-Market Order at any time before it is Filled. No fees are charged for canceled Orders.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            1.  A Limit Order is an Order to buy or sell a specified quantity of a Digital Asset at a specified price.<br />
                            2.  A Limit Order will only ever fill at the specified price or a better price.<br />
                            3.  A Limit Order with 'post-only' selected will only be posted to the Order Book if it would not have crossed in the last auction as a Taker Order. A Limit Order with 'post-only' selected will always be a Maker Order.<br />
                            4.  A Limit Order without 'post-only' selected will be immediately posted to the
                            Order Book (subject to any Time in Force Instructions) and can result in a Maker Order or a Taker Order.<br />
                            5.  Limit Orders will be placed with the following Time in Force Instructions: Good
                            til canceled. If posted, the Order will remain on the Order Book until canceled by the User.
                        </p>

                            Market Orders
                        </strong>

                        <p>
                            1. A Market Order is an Order to buy or sell a specified quantity of an Asset at the best available price of existing Orders on the Order Book.<br />
                            2. There is no guarantee that a Market Order will Fill or Fill at any expected price. A Market Order may Fill at a number of different prices, based on the quantity of

                            the Market Order and the quantities of the existing Orders on the Order Book at the time or in the current auction.<br />
                            3. Depending on the volume and prices of Orders on the Order Book at the time when a Market Order is posted, the Market Order may Fill at a price less favorable than the most recent trade price or quote, in some cases significantly so.<br />
                            4. A valid Market Order will be immediately posted to the Order Book. A Market Order is always a Taker Order.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <strong>
                            Stop Orders

                        </strong>

                        <p>
                            1. A Stop Order is an instruction to post an Order to buy or sell a specified quantity of an asset but only if and when the last trade price on the Order Book equals or surpasses the Stop Price.<br />
                            2. Once a Stop Order has been placed, it is considered 'active' until it executes by posting the relevant Order when the Stop Price is triggered.<br />
                            3. A Stop Order is not posted to the Order Book and is not visible to other Users, but any resulting Order is posted and visible. All Stop Orders are placed without “post-only” enabled.<br />
                            4. A Stop Order can be placed as a Stop Market Order, which posts a Market Order when the Stop Price is triggered, a Stop Limit Order, which posts a Limit Order when the Stop Price is triggered,
                            or a Trailing Stop Order, which causes the stop price to be adjusted with the order's trigger price.<br />
                            5. A Stop Market Order is subject to change in the same way as ordinary Market Orders. A Stop Limit Order is not guaranteed to Fill. The FundEZ Site will
                            display a warning each time a User attempts to place a Stop Order.<br />
                            6. Stop Orders may be placed with the following Time in Force Instructions.<br />
                            -  Good til canceled. If posted, the Order will remain on the Order Book until canceled by the User. This is the default Time in Force Instruction.<br />
                            -  The FundEZ Site will display a warning to Users who attempt to place an Order which would completely or partially fill at a price which is more
                            than 5% higher or lower than the last trade price (slippage warning).<br />
                            7. A Stop Market Order may be specified with either a fixed or percentage trail value, which causes the stop price to be pegged to no more than a fixed offset away from the order's trigger price (which is a fair price, index price, or last trade price, depending on the order's specified trigger type).When the trigger price moves away from the current stop price, the stop price is moved as well, thus the stop price trails the trigger price. (Note however that when the trigger price moves towards the current stop price, the stop price doesn't change, otherwise
                            the order would never trigger.)
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            A Take market or take limit order is the same as a stop market or limit order, but with the trigger directions reversed as follows:<br />

                            +  Buy - the take profit order triggers when the trigger price is less than or equal to the stop price<br />
                            +  Sell - the take profit order triggers when the trigger price is greater than or equal to the stop price

                        <p>
                            1. Taker Order. If an Order is posted to the Order Book at the same price as one or more existing Orders, it is a Taker Order which will result in a Fill at that price at the next auction, to the extent of the total quantity of those existing Orders.<br />

                            2. Maker Order. To the extent that an Order is posted to the Order Book at a
                            different price to all existing Orders, it is a Maker Order which will remain open at that price on the Order Book until: <br />
                            i.   It is canceled by the User; <br />
                            ii.  It expires due to a Time in Force Instruction; or <br />
                            iii. It is completely Filled by one or more Taker Orders placed by another User at the same price.

                            Auction Matching Engine and Order Priority.
                        </strong>
                        <p>
                            1. To the extent FundEZ's Order Book is operational, it will match Taker Orders with Open Maker Orders on each Order Book through Auctions with discrete Price-Time Priority. <br />
                            2. FundEZ conducts frequent discrete uniform-price sealed-bid double Auctions. In each auction, all of the outstanding orders are batched, and the aggregate
                            demand and supply functions are computed from orders to buy and sell. In each auction, there are two cases: supply and demand cross, or they do not. If there is a cross, orders will be filled. <br />
                            a.  If there is an intersection between supply and demand, there will be a volume-maximizing Crossing Range of prices, s.t. the volume of the auction would be maximized if it crossed at a price in that range. The
                            Crossing Range may be a single point (a single price), or a range of prices, or may not exist (if the supply and demand curves do not intersect). <br />
                            b.  If the Crossing Range consists of a single point, that will be the Crossing Price of the auction. If the Crossing Range includes a range of prices, the price closest to the midpoint of the Best Bid/Offer after the last auction is selected as the Crossing Price (in order to minimize price movement). (If there have been no previous auctions, the midpoint of the Crossing Range is used.) <br />
                            c.  At a given Crossing Price, there may be equal volume available on the Bid and Offer sides, or there may be an imbalance. If there is an imbalance, all of the crossing orders on the side with less volume will be filled in entirety, but some of the orders on the side with more volume will be filled only partially, or not at all. <br />

                            d.  Orders on the side of the imbalance are selected to be (partially) filled on the basis of Discrete Price-Time Priority. First, orders are prioritized by price -- orders with more aggressive prices (high for Bids, low for Offers) are prioritized first. Second, orders are prioritized by discrete time. The
                            time priority of an order is determined by the number of auctions it has been available to cross in -- older orders have higher priority, but orders that were received in the same auction batch are treated as having equal
                            priority with each other. (Note that modifying an order resets its priority.) <br />
                            e.  Thus, crossing orders on the side of the imbalance are divided into cohorts of equal Discrete Price-Time Priority. For a given cohort, either all of the orders in the cohort will be filled completely, or they will all be filled
                            pro-rata, or none of them will be filled, depending on the volume to fill remaining for that cohort, after filling orders in cohorts with higher priority. <br />

                            3. FundEZ settles all Filled Orders immediately, by instructing its custodian partners to debit and credit the relevant balances of assets on behalf of both users.

                            to purchase or sell a single Digital Asset (a “Buy Order” or “Sell Order”) in exchange for a fiat currency or another Digital Asset. The following set of Rules governs Orders placed via the RFQ system.
                        </p>
                        <strong>
                            RFQ Orders
                        </strong>
                        <p>
                            1. To place an Order, a User must have an available balance of the relevant trading pair in their Account which is sufficient to cover the total value of the Order plus any applicable fees.<br />
                            2. When a User places an Order, that quantity of the relevant trading pair becomes subject to a Hold.<br />
                            3. FundEZ only supports Market Orders (Buy or Sell) through the RFQ trading platform.<br />
                            4. Upon entering an Order for a specified quantity, the User will be presented with a Quote price and fees by FundEZ and/or our Liquidity Partners.<br />
                            5. The Quote price will be locked for 30 seconds (“Live Quote Period”) during which time, the User may accept or execute at the Quote Price or decline (Cancel) the<br />
                            Order. Orders Executed during the Live Quote Period will be considered final.<br />
                            6. When an Order is executed by the User, that Order is Filled.<br />
                            7. FundEZ settles all Filled Orders immediately, by debiting and crediting the relevant balances of Assets in the User's Account.<br />

                            8. Open Orders unexecuted after the Live Quote Period will be considered Expired after which you must input a new Order to execute a trade. No fees are charged for expired or canceled Orders.<br />

                        <p>
                            -  Virtual currency is not legal tender, is not backed by the government, and accounts and value balances are not subject to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or Securities Investor Protection Corporation protections.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            -  Legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the state, federal, or international level may adversely affect the use, transfer, exchange, and value of virtual
                            currency.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            -  Transactions in virtual currency may be irreversible, and, accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            -  Some virtual currency transactions shall be deemed to be made when recorded on a public ledger, which is not necessarily the date or time that the customer
                            initiates the transaction.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            -  The value of virtual currency may be derived from the continued willingness of market participants to exchange fiat currency for virtual currency, which may
                            result in the potential for permanent and total loss of value of a particular virtual currency should the market for that virtual currency disappear.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            -  There is no assurance that a person who accepts a virtual currency as payment today will continue to do so in the future.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            -  The volatility and unpredictability of the price of virtual currency relative to fiat currency may result in significant loss over a short period of time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            -  The nature of virtual currency may lead to an increased risk of fraud or cyber attack.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            -  The nature of virtual currency means that any technological difficulties experienced by FundEZ may prevent the access or use of a customer's virtual currency.
                        </p>
                        <p>-  Any bond or trust account maintained by FundEZ for the benefit of its customers may not be sufficient to cover all losses incurred by customers.</p>
                        <p>-  Fiat withdrawals and deposits, once initiated, can be stopped pursuant to FundEZ's policies and procedures, which follow traditional banking best practices. However, any transaction involving digital currencies, once initiated, may not be stoppable.</p>

                            FundEZ Markets has developed a Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Plan ("BCDRP") on how it will respond to events that significantly disrupt its business. Since the timing and impact of disasters and disruptions is unpredictable, FundEZ Markets will have to be flexible in responding to actual events as they occur. With that in mind, FundEZ Markets is providing you with this information on BCDRP.

                            go to the Firm's public website at https://@SystemHelper.Setting.ApplicationName/ for additional information.

                            <strong>Our Business Continuity Plan</strong>FundEZ Markets plans to quickly recover and
                            resume business operations after an SBD and respond by safeguarding its employees and property, making a financial and operational assessment, protecting the Firm's books and records and allowing its users to transact business. In short, the Firm's
                            BCDRP is designed to permit us to resume operations as quickly as possible, given the scope and severity of the SBD.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Firm's BCDRP addresses: data backup and recovery; all mission critical systems; financial and operational assessments; alternative communications with users, employees, and regulators; alternate physical location of employees; critical supplier,
                            contractor, bank and counter-party impact; regulatory reporting; and assuring its users prompt access to their funds if we are unable to continue its business.

                            <strong>Varying Disruptions</strong>SBDs can vary in scope, impacting only FundEZ Markets, a
                            single building, the region, city or business district in which we are located. Within each of these areas, the severity of the disruption can also vary from minimal to severe. In the event of a disruption impacting only FundEZ Markets or the building in which we are
                            located, we will transfer operations to a local site as needed, with the expectation to
                            recover aim to and resume business within 2 business days. In the event a disruption is wider in scope, affecting either the region, city or business district in which we are
                            located, we will transfer our operations to a site outside of the affected area and recover and aim to resume business within 3 business days. In the event of a disruption to the our data center, we will take steps to promptly transition to a different data center and

                            seek to recover and resume business within one business day. In any situation, FundEZ Markets plans to continue its business and keep you informed through our public
                            website (https://@SystemHelper.Setting.ApplicationName/ ) and by email. If the SBD is so severe that it prevents us from continuing its business, we will endeavor to provide users' prompt access to their funds.
